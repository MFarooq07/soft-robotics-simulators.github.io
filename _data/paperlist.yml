- abstract: 'While significant research progress has been made in robot learning for

    control, unique challenges arise when simultaneously co-optimizing morphology.

    Existing work has typically been tailored for particular environments or

    representations. In order to more fully understand inherent design and

    performance tradeoffs and accelerate the development of new breeds of soft

    robots, a comprehensive virtual platform with well-established tasks,

    environments, and evaluation metrics is needed. In this work, we introduce

    SoftZoo, a soft robot co-design platform for locomotion in diverse

    environments. SoftZoo supports an extensive, naturally-inspired material set,

    including the ability to simulate environments such as flat ground, desert,

    wetland, clay, ice, snow, shallow water, and ocean. Further, it provides a

    variety of tasks relevant for soft robotics, including fast locomotion, agile

    turning, and path following, as well as differentiable design representations

    for morphology and control. Combined, these elements form a feature-rich

    platform for analysis and development of soft robot co-design algorithms. We

    benchmark prevalent representations and co-design algorithms, and shed light on

    1) the interplay between environment, morphology, and behavior; 2) the

    importance of design space representations; 3) the ambiguity in muscle

    formation and controller synthesis; and 4) the value of differentiable physics.

    We envision that SoftZoo will serve as a standard platform and template an

    approach toward the development of novel representations and algorithms for

    co-designing soft robots'' behavioral and morphological intelligence.'

- abstract: "When simulating soft robots, both their morphology and their controllers\
    \ play\nimportant roles in task performance. This paper introduces a new method\
    \ to\nco-evolve these two components in the same process. We do that by using\
    \ the\nhyperNEAT algorithm to generate two separate neural networks in one pass,\
    \ one\nresponsible for the design of the robot body structure and the other for\
    \ the\ncontrol of the robot.\n  The key difference between our method and most\
    \ existing approaches is that it\ndoes not treat the development of the morphology\
    \ and the controller as separate\nprocesses. Similar to nature, our method derives\
    \ both the \"brain\" and the\n\"body\" of an agent from a single genome and develops\
    \ them together. While our\napproach is more realistic and doesn't require an\
    \ arbitrary separation of\nprocesses during evolution, it also makes the problem\
    \ more complex because the\nsearch space for this single genome becomes larger\
    \ and any mutation to the\ngenome affects \"brain\" and the \"body\" at the same\
    \ time.\n  Additionally, we present a new speciation function that takes into\n\
    consideration both the genotypic distance, as is the standard for NEAT, and the\n\
    similarity between robot bodies. By using this function, agents with very\ndifferent\
    \ bodies are more likely to be in different species, this allows robots\nwith\
    \ different morphologies to have more specialized controllers since they\nwon't\
    \ crossover with other robots that are too different from them.\n  We evaluate\
    \ the presented methods on four tasks and observe that even if the\nsearch space\
    \ was larger, having a single genome makes the evolution process\nconverge faster\
    \ when compared to having separated genomes for body and control.\nThe agents\
    \ in our population also show morphologies with a high degree of\nregularity and\
    \ controllers capable of coordinating the voxels to produce the\nnecessary movements."
